# GTAI
GTAI is a web application that allows users to buy cars and store them in a database. It provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to perform various operations on car listings. GTAI also includes authorization and authentication features for secure access.

# Overview

## Features
**User Registration:** Users can create an account by providing their email address and password.

**User Login:** Registered users can log in using their credentials to access the system.

**User Authentication:** Authentication is implemented to ensure that only authenticated users can perform actions such as adding, editing, or deleting car listings.

**Car Listing:** Users can view a list of available cars with details such as make, model, year, price, and mileage.

**Create Car:** Authenticated users can add new cars to the database by providing the necessary details such as make, model, year, price, and mileage.

**Update Car:** Authenticated users can edit and update the information of existing cars, including make, model, year, price, and mileage.

**Delete Car:** Authenticated users can remove cars from the database, effectively deleting the car listing.

**Search and Filter:** Users can search for specific cars by make, model, year, or any other relevant criteria. They can also apply filters to narrow down their search results based on price range, mileage, or other attributes.
